## Overview

A global data infrastructure company had invested in Fullstory for their UX team, but the platform was barely being used. A newly hired UX researcher needed training, and more importantly, the platform's value was confined to a single team when it could serve the entire organization.

I spent three months transforming Fullstory from an underutilized tool into an enterprise-wide platform through targeted training, executive engagement, and strategic problem-solving.

## What Worked Well

I started by training the new UX researcher, focusing on how Fullstory captured and surfaced data. They had strong analytics experience already, so we concentrated on power user techniques and building reports that could be shared across teams. They became the internal champion I hoped for.

Getting executives interested required showing business outcomes, not platform features. We demonstrated real insights using visualizations—actual user sessions and heat maps that made problems and opportunities immediately clear. This resonated far better than traditional analytics reports.

Once executives saw the value, we expanded to engineering. Multiple teams working in one unified platform meant everyone saw the same data, leading to better collaboration and faster problem-solving. We expanded their contract to include engineering and other teams.

Halfway through, I stepped in to solve a technical iframe issue blocking their progress. It wasn't in scope, but bridging the gap between the non-technical UX team, engineering, and Fullstory support kept the project moving forward.

## Positive Outcomes

- Platform expanded from single UX team to multiple departments
- Shared data visualization fostered cross-team collaboration
- UX researcher became confident internal champion
- Company expanded their Fullstory contract based on demonstrated ROI
- Three, six, and twelve-month roadmaps ensured continued momentum

The most satisfying part was seeing Fullstory become a shared language across teams. When everyone can visualize the same data and reference the same user sessions, it breaks down silos and enables collaboration that wasn't possible before.
